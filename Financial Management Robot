Project Name: Financial Management Robot

1. Project Summary:
Developing a financial management robot to help us manage our finances.

2. Background:
Our company spends money unevenly, sometimes spending too much, and sometimes too little, leading to financial disarray.

3. Application:
I will tell the robot how I want to spend money, and it will advise me on whether it is appropriate.

4. Data Source and AI Method:
Data Name: Disbursements in Trust Funds
Data Source: The World Bank
Data Description: Financial data related to trust funds.

AI Methods: Supervised Learning - Provide the machine with examples for learning.
           Recurrent Neural Networks - Enable the machine to remember what it has learned.

5. Challenges:
One of the challenges is obtaining relevant data, as it may involve private financial information.

6. Existing Similar AI Applications and Functionality:
Banks have loan approval robots that assess who should receive loans and who should not.

7. Next Steps:
Further improve the financial management robot
